##### Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to learn some basics about docker, for that i needed a simple project to start with.  
For that i didn't need to think long, the moment i saw <a href="https://tweetfleet.slack.com/messages/@craqgerbil" target="_blank">@craqgerbil's</a> username i knew i had to make an app for that.
